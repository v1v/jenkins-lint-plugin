Jenkins.Lint.Title         = JenkinsLint
Jenkins.Lint.Description   = The <a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JenkinsLint+Plugin">JenkinsLint Plugin</a> has mainly two goals:
Jenkins.Lint.Description.1 = <li>To make it easier to detect issues in your Jenkins configuration that will cause Jenkins to blow up when you attempt to run those jobs.</li>
Jenkins.Lint.Description.2 = <li>To encourage discussion within the Jenkins community on the more subjective stuff. Having a set of checks to base discussion on helps drive out what we as a community think is good style.</li>
